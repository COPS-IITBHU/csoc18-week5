imperial-inventory
===================

The _Empire_ has grown to new heights and it is becoming increasingly necessary to keep track of the vast inventory the great _Empire_ possesses. This one humble Django app from me is an offering.

## Features

* The site keeps track of all the transactions occuring in the inventory
* It also allows to add new traansactions
* It also allows to edit previously erred transactions (the _Empire_ is not bad as they say:))
* Since many transactions can have repeated items, the **View Weapons Summary** comes handy at knowing the vast diversity of the _Empire's_ might
* But to make any changes in transaction log, one must be registered in the _Empire's_ database. Since the _Empire_ believes in flourishment of social life, it has also login through Facebook, Google and Github features. Or the subject can register the traditional way.
* There are many instances of malicious transaction entries, to tackle which it has a geolocation API _(https://ipstack.com/)_ integrated so the _Empire_ knows your location.
* It is also helpful to the _Empire_ to keep track of the usage of the website, for which Google Analytics has provided support
